# Rice Classification Project

This repository contains the code and resources for a rice classification project using Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning techniques. The aim of this project is to develop a model capable of accurately classifying different varieties of rice based on images.

## Project Overview

Rice is one of the most important staple foods globally, and its quality and variety are crucial factors in the agricultural and culinary industries. Traditional methods of rice classification can be time-consuming and subjective, often relying on visual inspection by experts. This project seeks to automate and improve this process using modern AI and ML technologies.

## Approach

### Data Collection
We gathered a diverse dataset consisting of images of different rice varieties from various sources, including online repositories and in-house collections. Each image was labeled with its corresponding rice variety.

### Preprocessing
To prepare the data for training, we performed preprocessing steps such as resizing, normalization, and augmentation to enhance the model's robustness and generalization capabilities.

### Model Development
We experimented with several deep learning architectures, including convolutional neural networks (CNNs), to build our classification model. Transfer learning techniques were employed to leverage pre-trained models and adapt them to our specific task.

### Training and Evaluation
The model was trained on the prepared dataset using appropriate training protocols and hyperparameters. We evaluated its performance using standard metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score on both training and validation sets.
